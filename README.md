## What it is?

COVID-19 Visualizer is a simple web app made with React with the purpose of keep track and monitor the growth of COVID-19 cases across the world. You can check out the live version of the app through this link: [COVID-19 Visualizer](https://covid-19-cases-visualizer.herokuapp.com/).

As an alternative you can also run the project locally.

## Installing and running locally

To run locally you will need to install each of the below:

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14.17.2
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v7.19.1 or
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started) v1.22.10

This project has a backend and a frontend, and you have to run both to run the project. Since this is a monorepo you can run them without having to download other repository. If you don't know how to do this, I explain in these links:

- [How to install and run the backend](backend/README.md)
- [How to install and run the frontend](frontend/README.md)
